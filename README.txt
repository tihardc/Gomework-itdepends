Here you can find a simple and buggy web scrapper that browse the internet and download every image 
to your local machine.
To build and start just execute
-> go build
-> ./itdepends

And enjoy the output!
It's important to remember that scrapping generally is not what developers usually do: it can affect the performance 
of some small websites, and we always must be responsible and respect the work developers do. 
Our scrapper is just an example of it can work that shows some concepts. It generally works in a single thread, so, should not kill any webpage. 

But the application is beautiful: you can add some tests and use this code in any case you need.
